# COBAA

Title selection application for the Celebrating Ohio Book Awards & Authors (COBAA) grant.

## Description

The Celebrating Ohio Book Awards & Authors (COBAA) grant is an opportunity for Ohio libraries to apply for federal LSTA grant funds to build or expand a collection of books receiving honors and awards in Ohio and by Ohio authors. This title selection application makes applying easier by providing a browsable and searchable interface of eligible titles for the following awards:


* Ansfield-Wolf Book Award
* Buckeye Children's & Teen Book Awards
* Choose to Read Ohio Award Booklists
* Dayton Literary Peace Prize
* Floyd's Pick Book Award
* James Cook Book Award
* Norman A. Sugarman Childrenâ€™s Biography Award
* Ohioana Book Awards
* Thurber Prize for American Humor

# Tools Used

* Django
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap 5

# Usage

The title selection app is a Django web application. It can be configured to run on any web server or as a cloud web app (i.e. Azure App Service). To run the application locally, ensure that Python is installed, install the requirements for the app, and run the migrations and collectstatic

```python
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
export SECRET_KEY=INSERT_SECRET_KEY_HERE
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

Django expects to find your `SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable, but you can explicitly configure it in the [local.py](/cobaa/settings/local.py) or other settings file. There are also two management commands that have been created to easily import and export book information (title, authors, awards, tags, etc.):


```python3 manage.py import_books filename.txt```  
This will import specified file. Inspect the [import_books.py](/books/management/commands/import_books.py) for an example of the expected format.

```python3 manage.py export_books```  
This will export existing books and related information into an export.csv file. This can be used as a backup.
