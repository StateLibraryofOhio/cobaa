    <p>
      The <em>Celebrating Ohio Book Awards &amp; Authors (COBAA)</em> grant is a federally funded initiative administered by
      the State Library of Ohio. It supports Ohio libraries in developing their collections by providing up to
      $2,000 to purchase books by Ohio authors and titles recognized by Ohio-based book award programs. Since
      2016, COBAA has helped connect readers with local voices and award-winning literature, enriching communities
      and promoting literacy across the state.
